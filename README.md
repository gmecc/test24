Designing and manufacturing high-efficiency heat exchangers is usually considered a limiting factor in the development of both heat recovery Joule-Brayton cycles and closed-cycle (external combustion) gas turbine plants. In this work, an innovative heat exchanger is proposed, modeled and partially tested to validate the developed numerical model employed for its design. The heat exchanger is based on an intermediate medium (aluminum oxide Al2O3) flowing in counter-current through an hot stream of gas.
