Designing and manufacturing high-efficiency heat exchangers is usually considered a limiting factor in the development of both heat recovery Joule-Brayton cycles and closed-cycle (external combustion) gas turbine plants. In this work, an innovative heat exchanger is proposed, modeled and partially tested to validate the developed numerical model employed for its design. The heat exchanger is based on an intermediate medium (aluminum oxide Al2O3) flowing in counter-current through an hot stream of gas.

On the other side, full three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been performed to demonstrate that a more thorough gas flow and particle displacement analysis is needed to avoid some geometrical details that may cause a bad distribution of alumina particles, and thus to achieve high thermal efficiency.
